# Flow

`Flow` allows developers to express computations on collections, similar to the `Enum` and `Stream` modules, although computations will be executed in parallel using multiple `GenStage`s.

## Installation

Flow requires Elixir v1.3. Add `:flow` to your list of dependencies in mix.exs:

    def deps do
      [{:flow, "~> 0.11"}]
    end

## License

Same as Elixir.
